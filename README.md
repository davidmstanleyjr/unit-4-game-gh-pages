I hope you enjoy this game. I made this game to demonstrate my skill with Jquery and Javascript. The value of each crystal changes at the start of each game. Keep clicking the crystals until you reach the target score. If you reach it then you win but if you go over the score, you lose.

The main issue I came across with this game was getting each crystal to have a separate value that changes with each reset of the game. I solved this by using math.round and math.random to randomize the value of each crystal.
